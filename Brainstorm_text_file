# Very basic idea of the Final Project:
#    Make a visual novel game with randomly generated "math" as a gameplay element. Along with Text, Sprites. There will be an "Hp" system and a point tracker that will be the main core of the game loop.

# In summary:
#  So the player does a math question, changes the screen, tracks points, and program loops. If a player loses all "hp" points game ends.
# This formula is simple enough for us to initiate probably but then we add stuff like:
#          - Dialouge options
#          - Health potions "Regain points"
#          - Dialogue options during "gameplay"
